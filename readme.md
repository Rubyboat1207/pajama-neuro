# Pajama Neuro (WIP)

This is a WIP project that will allow for remote play of the game *Pajama Sam in "No need to hide when it's dark outside"* by the AI Neuro-Sama.

## Todo List:

- [X] ScummVM Loads Mod
- [X] Mod can see what room we're currently in
- [ ] Mod can affect the game
- [ ] Mod knows what's in Sam's inventory
- [X] Mod knows what actors are in each room
- [X] List of actions are available for what Neuro can interact with

As you can see, there's a lot left to do but we can do it!
